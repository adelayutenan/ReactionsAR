ReactionsAR is a mobile application developed to support interactive science learning through Augmented Reality (AR). Targeting elementary and junior high school students, the app simulates common science experiments—such as volcanic eruptions, lava lamps, and litmus tests—using smartphone cameras and printed marker cards.
